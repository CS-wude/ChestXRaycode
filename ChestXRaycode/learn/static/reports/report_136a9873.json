  "medical_report": "## 胸部X光片诊断报告\n\n**检查日期**: August 14, 2025\n**检查方式**: Chest X-ray (AI-assisted analysis)\n\n**影像学描述**: The chest X-ray image shows a clear view of the thoracic cavity with no obvious abnormalities. There is no evidence of pneumonia or other respiratory infections. The lungs are well-ventilated and there is no evidence of consolidation or pleural effusion. The mediastinum is normal, and there is no evidence of any masses or lesions. The bones and major vessels appear normal.\n\n**AI分析结果**:\n\n* Classification result: NORMAL\n* System confidence level: 73.9%\n\n**诊断意见**: Based on the AI-assisted analysis and my clinical experience, I conclude that the patient's chest X-ray is within normal limits. There is no evidence of pneumonia or other respiratory infections. The patient does not require further imaging studies at this time.\n\n**建议**:\n\n* Monitor the patient's symptoms and vital signs closely, and reassess if they worsen or if there are any changes in their condition.\n* Encourage the patient to adhere to their medication regimen as prescribed by their healthcare provider.\n* Schedule a follow-up appointment for the patient in 1-2 weeks to evaluate their progress and assess any further need for medical intervention.\n\n**备注**:\n\n* This report is based on the AI-assisted analysis and is intended solely as a clinical reference. The final diagnosis should be made after taking into account the patient's entire clinical presentation, including their medical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.\n* Any questions or concerns regarding this report should be addressed to the relevant specialist physician.",
